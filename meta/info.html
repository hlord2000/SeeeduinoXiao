    <h1>XIAO/QT Py Template</h1>
    
    <p>
      This project template is the basis of an expansion board for the <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html">Seeed Studio XIAO</a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4600">Adafruit QT Py</a> form factors. It includes a PCB edge matching the outline of the Xiao PCB with connectors and mounting holes placed correctly to align the two boards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: due to the fact that the official 3D library does not include "long" or "stacking" female headers, the default Connector_PinSocket_2.54mm models were used.
